# POGA
Portfolio Optimizing Genetic Algorithm


POGA is a program that I made to optimize portfolio allocations for the maximum return with the minimum risk based on user inputted parameters such as risk tolerance. It uses theories of evolution and genome sequencing to create stochasticly initialized portfolio asset allocations (or weights) and then creates a user defined quantity of genomes (comprised of these asset weights) that are all run on historical stock data for any combination of equities. The results are scored on a cost function and the most fit genomes move on and are more likely to be reproduced or result in similar variations over the course of (n) number of evolutions.
